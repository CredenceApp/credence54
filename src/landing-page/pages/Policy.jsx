            Credence is a platform focused on Farmers and Agri-SMEs, bridging
            agritech (Market Access) and fintech (Credit and Escrow Services).
            Our digital platform is designed to enhance productivity,
            efficiency, and income, fostering an enabling environment for
            agribusiness at scale in Nigeria.

            improved prices, and enhanced efficiency throughout the agri-food
            supply chain, both upstream and downstream of the farmer. Our goal
            is to elevate the cash flow of Smallholder Farmers (SHFs) and
            agri-SMEs by offering more accessible options, streamlined payments,
            and efficient product distribution.

            In the context of your involvement in the Credence Marketplace,
            credit information obtained from you or a credit reporting body,
            along with derived data, is strictly utilized for the sole purpose
            of evaluating your credit application. If you choose not to
            authorize us to access your credit information, it may hinder our
            ability to assess your creditworthiness and, consequently, your
            suitability for prepayment under our model agreement. In such
            instances, there is a possibility that your credit request may be
            declined.

            in the Credence Marketplace, we may, when permitted by law, disclose
            your Personal Data to credit reporting bodies. This disclosure is
            particularly relevant in situations where there is a failure to meet
            payment obligations concerning consumer credit. The information
            shared with credit reporting bodies may be included in reports
            provided to other credit providers, aiding them in evaluating your
            creditworthiness.
